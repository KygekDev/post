## About Posts by KygekDev

I am interested on sharing knowledge and information to the public, such as tutorials, life lessons, and other important information. My philosophy is to educate people, especially beginners, through my posts in an understanble way, as I have been realizing that high-quality education is crucial in these dystopic days. Besides that, I hope that I can contribute to the global knowledge through these simple posts in some ways, so they can be useful for many people.

You can check out my GitHub account as well as my YouTube channel (link is provided below) for examples of my work and more tutorials. I hope you enjoy reading my posts and find them useful for you.
