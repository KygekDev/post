You can see that COVID-19 cases in Indonesia has skyrocketed in the past 5 days.

## Predictions

Epidemiologist from Griffith University, Dicky Budiman, predicts that the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 will occur in mid-February and will be centered in the Java-Bali region. [2]

He also predicts daily cases at the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 will reach 500,000 cases. However, due to the limited testing capacity, the achievement of these figures may not occur. [2]
